# Statistics-of-Extremes
Codes, data files etc. related to Bachelor's thesis.

This repository contains files associated with my Bachelor's thesis project. The title of the thesis is "ON THE STATISTICS OF EXTREMES IN SELF-DRIVEN PARTICLES", and it aims to model certain "active" particles and to study certain rare behaviours in them.
In particular we try to mathematically model an experimental setup that was used to verify certain fluctuation relations involving entropy production (and consumption).
