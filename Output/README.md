# Output
This directory contains processed output files of the pytho script plot_ldf-multiple-tau-D-F.py. The output files are labelled by the parameter values used and a time-stamp (to prevent overwriting). The files have two columns--- W_tau and J(W_tau), the entropy production and the corresponding value of the large deviation rate funtion.
